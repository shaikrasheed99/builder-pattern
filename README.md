# Builder pattern example using Test Driven Development

## Example (Car):

* There are two different types of cars.
* Normal cars and Electric cars should be created with the builders.
* Electric car builder would create electric car from it.
* Normal car builder would create normal car.
* Since, the state of the car is so long and client cannot remember everything and their order.
* So the client uses these builders to a car from parameters which he remembers.
